# Parameter catalogue — auto-generated 2026-05-26

Single source of truth for the 27 IPCC-aligned parameters the cattle uncertainty app expects.
When you (Claude) translate a user's raw column to a template field, use this table.
All parameter codes are case-sensitive.

## Asymmetric (non-symmetric) bounds

These parameters use absolute IPCC-derived lower/upper bounds rather than a symmetric ±% around the central value.

| code | lower | central | upper |
|------|-------|---------|-------|
| `EF3_PRP` | 0.007 | 0.004 | 0.06 |
| `EF3_S` | 0.001 | 0.005 | 0.025 |
| `Frac_GASMS` | 0.1 | 0.21 | 0.4 |
| `EF4` | 0.002 | 0.01 | 0.02 |
| `EF5` | 0.0005 | 0.011 | 0.025 |
| `Frac_LEACH_H` | 0.01 | 0.02 | 0.1 |

| `Frac_LEACH_PRP` | 0.05 | 0.24 | 0.8 |

## Tier meaning

- **core** = user must provide a value (or accept the IPCC default). These are the activity-data parameters and a handful of high-impact coefficients (DE, CP, MilkPR).
- **advanced** = IPCC equation coefficient. Pre-filled with the IPCC default from the column above; only override if the user has a country-specific measurement.

## param_type

- **activity_data** = `N` only (animal population). This is the one true activity-data variable.
- **coefficient** = everything else (production parameters, energy/methane/N₂O coefficients).

## Distribution codes accepted

`normal`, `posnorm`, `lognormal`, `beta`, `triangular`, `pert`, `uniform`, `constant`, `tnorm_0_1`

Use `pert` or `triangular` when only a mode + bounds are known; `normal` for symmetric ±% around a measured mean; `beta` or `tnorm_0_1` for fractions that must stay in [0, 1]; `lognormal` for strictly-positive values with right skew (typical for emission factors).
