## Findings & recommendations

Even though every formal test passed, two minor robustness issues surfaced while building the harness. Neither is reachable from normal app use, but both are worth documenting:

**1. `run_inventory_simulation()` crashes with `n_iter = 1` on a single-system inventory.**

Location: `R/mc_simulation.R` lines ~199-211. The data-frame construction uses `rowSums(sapply(by_system, function(s) s$results$some_col))`. When `by_system` has a single entry and `n_iter = 1`, `sapply` returns a length-1 vector (not a matrix), and `rowSums()` then throws *"'x' must be an array of at least two dimensions"*. This is not reachable from the live app (the UI's iteration slider has a minimum of 1,000) but it makes the function fragile for unit testing or any caller that might pass a single iteration. Cheap fix: wrap each `sapply(...)` in `as.matrix()` or guard with `if (length(by_system) == 1L) ...`.

**2. Country X synthetic time-series has perfectly linear `Milk` growth (5 years × 0.2 kg/day, no noise).**

Location: `R/utils_ipcc_defaults.R::generate_country_x_timeseries()`. First-differencing collapses the `Milk` column to a constant (every diff = 0.2), which gives `sd = 0` and breaks any naive `cor()` call. The app's own `compute_correlation_from_timeseries()` handles this correctly (line 264 drops zero-variance columns), but the synthetic series is unrealistic — a real time series would have noise. Cheap fix: add a small jitter (±0.05) to one of the Milk values so the series exercises the auto-correlation path realistically.

## Methodology notes

- Deterministic checks (Section A) use `n_iter = 1` with every parameter's distribution set to `"constant"`. The simulator collapses to a single deterministic call through the IPCC equation chain, which lets us compare each intermediate against a hand-computed reference value to within `TOL_REL = 1e-4` relative tolerance.
- Monte Carlo convergence checks (Sections B, D) use `n_iter = 50,000` or `500` and compare empirical statistics (mean, Spearman rank correlation) against analytical expectations to within `TOL_MC = 0.02` absolute on correlations, `0.01` relative on means.
- The audit does NOT go through the Shiny `input$` / observer layer — it calls `run_inventory_simulation()`, `calc_*` functions, `validate_*` functions, and the export builders directly. UI rendering, button-click flow, and tooltip text are not exercised here. (If the calculation engine is correct, the UI shows correct numbers; the rendering layer's bugs would be a separate UX audit.)
- The hand-comp treats the equation forms as implemented in `R/calc_*.R`. The audit does not re-verify those equation forms against the IPCC source PDFs — that was the May-2026 IPCC alignment audit's scope.

## Reproducibility

Run `Rscript _audit.R` from the repo root. Output is deterministic conditional on the seeds in each test block.
