# Dirichlet MMS-allocation sampling (introduced in Round 7 T4.21) was removed

# 2019 Refinement guidance, and the diagnostic run-through proved it leaves
# the mean of every emission source unchanged (Dirichlet preserves marginal
# means when per-MMS coefficients are constant). MMS% is now deterministic,
# matching the IPCC Inventory Software's behaviour. If the feature ever needs
# to come back, the previous `sample_dirichlet_simplex` implementation lives
# in git history at commit 4191b73.

# preserved by the sampler in mc_simulation.R per IPCC Vol.1 Ch.3 §3.2.3.2.
